        <h3>For all you put into your service, MILITARY STAR wants you to get more back.</h3>
        <p>
          The MILITARY STAR card and its benefits are exclusively available to military personnel and their families,
          DoD Civilians, Purple Heart recipients and Disabled Veterans and Veterans who received an Honorable or general
          under Honorable conditions discharge have online shopping privileges. This line of credit is designed to
          assist you with your financial needs, whether it’s an everyday purchase or one unique to your military
          lifestyle, such as PCS, deployment or retirement items. As a "thank you" for shopping the Exchange,
          cardholders also receive personal dividends through the MILITARY STAR Rewards Program.
        </p>
        <h3>Earn 2% Rewards on Every Purchase <sup>†</sup></h3>
        <p>
          Through the MILITARY STAR Rewards Program, you will earn 2% in rewards on every purchase except the Military
          Clothing Plan. 2% equals two points for every dollar you spend when you use your MILITARY STAR card at
          exchange stores; commissaries; Armed Forces Recreation Center resort hotels; and online at
          <em>shop<strong>CGX</strong>.com</em>. You can also earn points at Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Service food
          courts, Express<sup>®</sup> locations, Exchange mall vendors and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every 2,000 points accumulated, you’ll automatically earn a $20 MILITARY STAR Rewards Card, which can be
          redeemed for merchandise or services anywhere Exchange gift cards are accepted. Plus, there’s no limit to how
          many cards you can earn each year.
        </p>
